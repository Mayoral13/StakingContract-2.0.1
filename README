/*****************
This is a Staking Contract whereby a user
stakes a certain amount of tokens into the contract
the contract burns the token for the stake then the user
gets rewarded a portion of the staked contract in form of a reward
the reward is then minted by the contract,
once the user removes his stake the contract mints the staked amount for the user

/**** FEATURES
A reward system
users cannot remove stake or stakeholder when rewards have not been claimed
in order to check reward the DistributeReward function must be used or else you wont be able to claim rewards
users can only claim entire rewards
The tokens and rewards use the MayoralToken (feel free to use that one too)

 /**** PROBLEM
 Users can call the DistributeReward function multiple times to cheat the reward system
